The **HUST Vision Lab**, led by **[Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/)**, is a research group at the Artificial Intelligence Institute, School of Electronic Information and Communications, **[Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)**.

We are dedicated to pushing the frontiers of general visual intelligence and perception. Our core research areas include:

* Multimodal Foundation Models
* Visual Representation Learning
* Object Detection, Segmentation, and Tracking
* End-to-end Autonomous Driving
* Novel Neural Architectures

Our contributions to the field include a portfolio of influential works such as [CCNet](https://github.com/speedinghzl/CCNet), [Mask Scoring R-CNN](https://github.com/zjhuang22/maskscoring_rcnn), [FairMOT](https://github.com/ifzhang/FairMOT), [ByteTrack](https://github.com/FoundationVision/ByteTrack), [EVA](https://github.com/baaivision/EVA), [MapTR](https://github.com/hustvl/MapTR), [Vectorized Autonomous Driving (VAD)](https://github.com/hustvl/VAD), [DiffusionDrive](https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionDrive), [Vision Mamba (Vim)](https://github.com/hustvl/Vim), [4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)](https://github.com/hustvl/4DGaussians), [YOLOS](https://github.com/hustvl/YOLOS), [YOLO-World](https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World), and [LightningDiT & VA-VAE](https://github.com/hustvl/LightningDiT).
